My Insight data science consulting project 
Automating wildlife animal detection for the Golden Gate National parks center in California.
There are thousands of photos captured by motion activated cameras installed at different locations of the park. They take photo once they detect a moving object. However, more than 95% of the time the moving body is not a real animal. Moving tree branches, leaves and people such as hikers, etc. are among the common targets in these photos.
I am developing a pipeline to automate the animal detection process using their pool of images.
